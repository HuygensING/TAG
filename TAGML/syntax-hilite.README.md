## TAGML Syntax highlighting in editors

# Sublime Text
- Download <https://cdn.huygens.knaw.nl/alexandria/sublime-tagml-package.zip>
- In [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/), open the packages directory by selecting menu option `Preferences`/`Browse packages`
- unpack the zip file into this directory.
- From the Sublime Text menu `Preferences`/`Color scheme...`, choose the `MonokaiFreeTAGML` scheme.
- Open a `".tagml"` file.

- If you start working on a new file that hasn't been saved yet (and thus has no filename), Sublime cannot automatically recognize it as a TAGML file, and so you won't see any syntax highlighting.
  To remedy this, either save the text to a file with a `.tagml` or `.tag` extension, or manually set the content type by clicking on 'Plain Text' in the bottom right of the Sublime window, and selecting 'TAGML'.
