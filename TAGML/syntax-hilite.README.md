## TAGML Syntax highlighting in editors

# Sublime Text
- See <https://github.com/HuygensING/tagml-sublime-syntax/blob/master/README.md>

- If you start working on a new file that hasn't been saved yet (and thus has no filename), Sublime cannot automatically recognize it as a TAGML file, and so you won't see any syntax highlighting.
  To remedy this, either save the text to a file with a `.tagml` or `.tag` extension, or manually set the content type by clicking on 'Plain Text' in the bottom right of the Sublime window, and selecting 'TAGML'.
